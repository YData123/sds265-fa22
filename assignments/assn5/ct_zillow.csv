The land offers rare potential either as a renovation opportunity or as a new build given the dramatic vistas of the Shepaug River Valley afforded by the elevation and 240-degree views. The Dickinson Dairy House (aka the Seruphas Ward House c. 1845) is a vernacular farmhouse influenced by the Greek Revival style. It is composed of an early 19th-century center hall building and a recessed kitchen wing to the south with a full English basement at the rear. The Dairy House provides an interesting perspective how country builders at this time integrated both colonial and Greek Revival styles in Litchfield County. The home has not been occupied since the current owner purchased the property and it requires extensive renovation. Located to the south of the house is the Greyledge Barn -- constructed in 1996 and built of weathered siding from a barn in Indiana to replicate the look and aesthetic of a calving barn of similar size that used to occupy the rocky promontory that defines Greyledge Farm and the Estate. The barn is now used primarily for vehicle and equipment storage; however, it can be easily repurposed as it has a poured concrete floor, excellent natural light, and the structural integrity of a new building.
